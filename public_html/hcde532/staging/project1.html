            Only 1 out of 10 animals in the shelters finds a permanent home, while 2.7 million dogs and cats are put to sleep each year because they were not adopted. Lots of people are interested in owning a pet, but they may be unaware or not interested in pet adoption.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of this project is to improve communication between animal shelters and those interested in pet ownership, bring awareness of pet adoption and to improve animal shelters' role in the community and save lives of animals.

            <b>Furever Pal</b> is a mobile application that helps people finding the right pet to adopt. It's built with a Tinder-inspired pet finder where user could easily browse and select their preferred pet by swiping left or right, and a innovative feature enabled with Augmented Reality (AR) to simulate pet owning experience in real life.

                <b>User Research</b>
                <br>
                The journey of going from an inspiration to a tangible design solution started with user research. Once the team decided on tackling the problem of low pet adoption rate of Seattle, we conducted user research using methods to gain deeper understanding of the design question:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Survey</b> - our survey targeted potential and experienced pet adopters, received over 90 responses within one week.</li>
                    <li><b>Interviews</b> - we interviewed three local animal shelters to throughly understand the pet adoption process being implemented at Seattle.</li>
                    <li><b>Contextual Inquiry</b> - by participating in a pet adoption event held by Ginger's Pet Rescue, we had the chance to observe the experience of adopting a pet from both adopter and animal shelter personnels' perspective.</li>
                </ul>
                The research revealed the fact that pet adoption process at Seattle is simple and efficient, while the difficulty of finding the right pet for adopters lies within decision making on finding the right pet. <br><br>
                With that finding, we refined our design question to be:
                <br><br>
                <i><b>How might we improve the pet finding experience, so that the decision making for pet adopter is easier?</b></i>

        <div class="project-heading2">
            Personas
        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
            With our research findings, we defined the personas of our project to be potential pet adopters, and set out to design a solution that helps them discover and connect with pets that are best suited for their requirements and conditions.

                <b>Ideate, Sketch, and Repeat</b>
                <br>
                To achieve our design goal of "finding the right pet", the team started the process of ideation, sketching, evaluation and reiteration. We filtered the ocean of ideas to look for ones that will uphold our design requirements, light up the user experience, and tackle the design question.
                <br><br>
                After many rounds of brainstorming and discussions, the ideas that stood out from others were:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Tinder-inspired pet finding experience, where user could easily browse and select their preferred pet by swiping left or right.</li>
                    <li>A virtual experience enabled by Augmented Reality (AR) to simulate pets at users' home, allow potential pet adopters to emotionally connect with the pet without the need of visiting animal shelters.</li>
                </ul>
                By combining these two ideas, we started working on the design solution that will address the primary use case and tackle the design question.

                <b>Prototyping</b>
                <br>
                As the prototyping engineer, I worked on bringing the user experience of our design solution to life, by building a high-fidelity prototype that is highly-interactive and intuitive.
                <br><br>
                Picking the right tool for prototyping was not always easy. I chose <b><a href="https://origami.design/">Origami Studio</a></b> for this project with consideration of a few unique advantages it offers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile optimized and native support for simulating a wide range of iOS and Android devices.</li>
                    <li>Capability for advanced programmability on interactions and page transitions, allowed me to closely resemble the user experience of prototype to actual working product.</li>
                    <li>Ability to run the interactive prototype on the mobile device, which significantly improved the experience of usability testing.</li>
                    <li>Easiness of recording a series of interactions into a demo video.</li>
                </ul>

            Usability Testing
        </div>
        <div class="project-description">
            We conducted 5 usability testings using high-fi prototype that runs on mobile devices. The result showed that 4 out 5 users found our design solution make finding adoptable pets more efficient. With the feedback collected from testing, we reiterate the design process and make several improvements such as adding a "Regret" button on the swiping interface, and rebranding the "AR" feature so it's understood by more people.
